## Why this fork over other versions?
The main repo from Orbmu2k isn't updated often & since then their have been many forks adding new content to the program, this fork combines all those into one & also maintains future support for new features, such as adding support for DLSS related toggles.

## New Features
- More settings (RTX HDR, Dynamic Vibrance, DLSS, Sharpening, Stereocopic, Anti-Aliasing, Latency, etc)
- Improved usability of the search/filter field (automatically applies as you type, can be cleared with "escape" key)
- Improved error messaging
- Faster load times
- Bug fixes

## Disclaimer

- Must use NVIDIA driver 572.83+ for full access to every new NVPI feature

## Acryonyms

- SR = Super Resolution *(DLSS Upscaling & DLAA Anti-Alasing)*
- RR = Ray Reconstruction
- FG = Frame Generation
