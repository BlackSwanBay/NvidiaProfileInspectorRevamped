## Why this fork over other versions?
The main repo from Orbmu2k hasn't been updated in years & since then their have been many forks adding new content to the program, this fork combines all those into one & also maintains future support for new features, such as adding support for DLSS related toggles.

## New Features
- More settings such as RTX HDR and Dynamic Vibrance, overrides for DLSS 3.1+, image sharpening, Stereocopic viewing options
- Improved usability of the search/filter field (automatically applies as you type, can be cleared using the "escape" key)
- Bug fixes
- Improved error messaging
- Faster load times
