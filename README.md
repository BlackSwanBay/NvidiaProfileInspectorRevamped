## What is the purpose of this fork? Why does it exist?

This fork focuses on a few things

1 - The inclusion of more quality of life options to help modernize the app

2 - Documenting & naming unknown & unamed settings, so end users can better see what they're changing

3 - Organizing settings in ways that make more sense so they're easier to search for and apply (e,g, when a list of options is given, lay out the options from smallest to largest, recategorizing where settings go, etc)

## Other New Things

Other than the stated things above, here's some additional changes the tool makes over the original

- Exposed several settings that were otherwise not visible without a CustomSettingNames.xml file
- Improved usability of the search/filter field, e.g. it automatically applies as you type, can be cleared using the "escape" key, etc
- Code formatting improvements and bug fixes
- Improved error messaging
- Improved performance (fast load, etc)

![](/nspector/Images/n1-016.png) **NVIDIA Profile Inspector**

This tool is used for modifying game profiles inside the internal driver database of the nvidia driver.
All game profiles are provided by the nvidia driver, but you can add your own profiles for games missing in the driver database.
You also have access to hidden and undocumented settings, which are not provided by the drivers control panel.

For more information how to use this tool, you can find some very good wikis here:
