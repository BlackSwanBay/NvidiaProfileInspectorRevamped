## Why this fork over other versions?
The original repo for NVIDIA Profile Inspector from Orbmu2k has had many forks over the years, adding various QoL & performance improvements to it. This fork combines all the community made improvements from over the years into one 'ultimate' version of the app to modernize it.

This version of the tool is also the most active, being updated more often by adding support for the latest features first.

## New Features
- More settings (RTX HDR, Dynamic Vibrance, DLSS, Sharpening, Stereocopic, Anti-Aliasing, Latency, etc)
- Improved usability of the search/filter field (automatically applies as you type, can be cleared with "escape" key)
- Improved error messaging
- Faster load times
- Bug fixes

## Disclaimer

- Must use NVIDIA driver 572.83+ for full access to every new NVPI feature

## Acryonyms

- SR = Super Resolution *(DLSS Upscaling & DLAA Anti-Alasing)*
- RR = Ray Reconstruction
- FG = Frame Generation
